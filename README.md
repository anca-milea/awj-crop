# awj-crop

A project I did for my Web Applications & Java course in university.

It's a Java app that translates an image with the values you specify on the X-Axis and Y-Axis.
During this project, I learned to use JFrame to display images, packages and parent classes, interfaces and abstract classes, and more.

Inputs: 
Input file name
Output file name
X-Axis translation
Y-Axis translation
